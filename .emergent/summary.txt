The AI engineer's work progressed through distinct phases, starting with foundational bug fixes and core feature enhancements like daily login and clinic registration. A significant architectural shift involved merging  and  roles and introducing Lines Management. Recent efforts refined UI/UX, incorporating performance cards, colored clinic categorization, mini-profiles, and an invoice-based debt system. A major refactor of the backend, splitting  into modular models and routes, was undertaken to resolve confusion in settings. The latest phase intensely focused on a complete redesign of the login page and, more critically, the dashboard, with the user demanding a highly professional, modern, animated, and horizontally navigated UI. This involved multiple iterations of code fixes (e.g., , ) and component refactoring, demonstrating an iterative, detail-oriented approach to front-end development.

The EP Group System is an enterprise application designed for multi-level user and warehouse management, supporting Arabic/English, with dynamic themes and global search. It provides CRUD operations for warehouses and products, advanced invoicing, hierarchical order approval, and monthly planning. Previous work included bug fixes, user management improvements, region-specific stock status, automated invoicing, mini-profiles, enhanced location tracking, and UI redesigns for order creation, visit registration, and monthly planning. The primary problem initially tackled was persistent frontend compilation errors. Recent user requests have focused on: merging  and  into a single executive role, implementing a Lines Management system with manager assignments, enhancing user management with performance cards, intelligent colored clinic categorization (new/green, featured/gold, debt/red), comprehensive clinic mini-profiles, and an integrated invoice-based debt system. Further enhancements included a debt warning for orders, manager inclusion in visit logs, restricted rep profile views, a detailed movement log system, and a completely revamped, modern, animated, and professional dashboard and horizontal navigation menu.

<current_work>
Immediately prior to this summary, the AI engineer was intensely focused on a major UI/UX overhaul of the application's dashboard and login page based on explicit user feedback.

The user initially requested a modern, professional, animated, and graphical dashboard, and subsequently, a professional login page with show/remember password, modern styling, animations, and support ticket integration.

The work involved:
1.  **Backend Refactoring (Bug Fix - Chat 117-172)**: A significant effort was made to address confusion/conflict () in the backend settings. This led to a complete restructuring of  into a modular design with new  and  directories. All Pydantic models were moved to domain-specific files within , and API routes were intended to be moved to . This was a major clean-up to improve code organization and maintainability.
2.  **Login Page Redesign (Chat 63-74)**:  was modified to implement a modern, transparent, glass-effect login form with a dynamic background, show/remember password toggles, and new buttons for login and technical support.
3.  **Support System Implementation (Chat 59-62, 75-108)**: Backend APIs for a support ticket system were added to . On the frontend, a new  component was created and integrated into the  within  as a new tab, visible only to admins.
4.  **Dashboard Redesign and Debugging (Chat 174-281)**: This was the most recent and iterative task. The user was highly critical of initial dashboard designs.
    *   The AI engineer attempted to create an UltraModernDashboard component, but faced persistent parsing errors and  errors in  due to incorrect placement of React hooks and components outside functional components.
    *   Multiple debugging cycles involved locating and removing floating code and syntax errors.
    *   Eventually, a  error was fixed by correctly integrating the  component and ensuring its parameters were correctly passed and consumed.
    *   After resolving the  error, the user still expressed dissatisfaction with the UltraModernDashboard style, requesting an Enterprise-level Dashboard with professional aesthetics and horizontal navigation.
    *   The engineer then proceeded to replace the  component with a  component and started adding its associated CSS.

At the very end of the trajectory, the AI engineer had successfully replaced the  with  and added its new CSS, and was in the process of updating the dashboard's invocation. The backend system has been largely refactored and is stable (92.9% success rate in last backend tests). The current focus is entirely on the frontend UI/UX, specifically the dashboard's visual design and navigation.

<optional_next_step>
The next step is to finalize the implementation of the  component, including updating its invocation in  to render the newly styled dashboard, and then verifying its appearance and functionality.
