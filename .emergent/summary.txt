The AI engineer successfully progressed the EP Group System from MVP to a robust enterprise solution. Initial efforts focused on core features like roles, admin, and the tech stack (React, FastAPI, MongoDB), removing chat functionality. Subsequent phases introduced a Warehouse Keeper Dashboard, an Approval System, enhanced User Management, and Monthly Planning. Recently, the AI addressed explicit user requests: unifying header theme toggles, refining user registration (e.g., no manager option, Job Title instead of Role), implementing a full invoicing system with tiered pricing and cashback, and comprehensive product management. Over 20 new backend APIs were developed to support these features. Crucially, the AI fixed language system issues (translations, RTL) and implemented a mini profile for user details, integrating it into the header. The latest iterations primarily focused on a sophisticated location tracking system, where the AI successfully integrated Google Maps API for precise clinic registration and stealthy order location tracking for admin oversight, overcoming initial integration challenges by using direct HTML script loading.

<product_requirements>
The EP Group System is an enterprise management solution providing dynamic themes, global search, and comprehensive user/warehouse management. It supports full Arabic/English translation and a 7-level organizational hierarchy (GM to Medical Rep) across Line 1/Line 2 divisions. Key features include full CRUD for warehouses/products, advanced invoicing with tiered pricing and cashback, and a hierarchical order approval system. The application also provides a monthly planning system for reps and managers, and enhanced user management with fields for region and direct manager. Recent explicit user demands focused on: ensuring all buttons/functions work correctly for all user roles with comprehensive admin configurability, unifying the header's theme toggle, improving UI color consistency, refining user registration (e.g., no manager option, renaming Role to Job Title, making fields optional), displaying stock status for sales reps, automatic invoicing for every order with detailed edit tracking for admin, and a comprehensive mini profile accessible from the header. Subsequent critical updates included fixing Google Maps for clinic registration (with user-selected and rep's actual location tracking for admin), stealthy location tracking for orders, refined user/warehouse structures, rep ability to manage plans, professional approval system, detailed clinic profiles (Line 1/2 categorization, visits, orders, debt), and daily login selfie/fingerprint for reps.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was implementing and testing the comprehensive location tracking system for the Admin, as requested by the user.

Specifically, the AI engineer:
1.  **Updated Clinic Registration**: Modified the  component in  (). This involved updating the form submission to secretly capture the sales rep's actual GPS coordinates () when a clinic is registered, in addition to the user-selected clinic location. It also involved fixing parsing errors and correctly integrating the  component to allow reps to select a clinic location on the map.
2.  **Added Stealth Location Tracking to Orders**: Modified the  component in  (). This ensured that when a sales rep creates an order, their actual GPS coordinates at the time of order creation are secretly recorded, without their knowledge, for admin oversight.
3.  **Created Admin Location Tracking Interface**: Developed a new  component () and integrated it into the frontend () with a dedicated tab and button for administrators (). This interface is designed to display both clinic registration locations and order creation locations, including the rep's actual location, clinic/order location, and distance differences for admin review.
4.  **Updated Backend for Location Data**: Added new APIs in  to handle the storage and retrieval of these new location data points (). Crucially, the  and  Pydantic models were updated to include the  field () to support the new stealth tracking.
5.  **Testing and Data Generation**: Performed comprehensive backend testing () which reported 100% readiness for location tracking. Followed up with frontend testing () which confirmed successful Google Maps integration and UI functionality. The AI also created and executed a  script () to populate the database with test data for clinics and orders, including the new location fields, to facilitate further testing of the admin tracking interface.

The trajectory ends with the AI having successfully created sample data and preparing for a final comprehensive test of all map systems.
