The AI engineer successfully progressed the EP Group System through several critical development cycles. Initial work involved resolving pervasive frontend compilation errors and refining core functionalities like daily login and clinic registration with Google Maps. This was followed by a comprehensive technical review and cleanup of the codebase and database. Subsequently, the engineer executed a significant architectural refactor, merging  and  roles, introducing a full Lines Management system with dedicated APIs and UI, and ensuring hierarchical linkages. Most recently, the focus shifted to implementing advanced UI/UX features: enhanced user management dashboards with performance cards, an intelligent colored clinic categorization system (green for new, gold for featured, red for debt), a detailed clinic mini-profile, and a robust invoice-based debt management system. The engineer consistently updated  and created detailed reports, demonstrating an iterative, user-feedback-driven development approach.

<product_requirements>
The EP Group System is an enterprise solution with dynamic themes, global search, and multi-level user/warehouse management, supporting Arabic/English. It features CRUD for warehouses/products, advanced invoicing, hierarchical order approval, and monthly planning. Key past improvements included bug fixes, user management refinements, region-specific stock status, automatic invoicing, mini-profiles, enhanced location tracking, replacing selfie-login with fingerprint/location, and UI redesigns for Create Order, Visit Registration, and Monthly Planning. The immediate problem addressed was persistent frontend compilation errors and subsequent sales rep functionality issues. Recent explicit requests involved: merging  and  roles into one executive role capable of adding clinics, implementing a Lines Management system with manager assignments, enhancing user management with detailed performance cards, professional colored clinic categorization (new, featured, debt), comprehensive clinic mini-profiles, and an integrated invoice-based debt system.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer completed a significant set of enhancements based on the user's explicit instructions. This work focused on improving user management, clinic categorization, clinic insights, and financial tracking within the EP Group System.

Specifically, the following was implemented:
1.  **Enhanced User Management for Admin**: A detailed performance card system was added for each user, providing comprehensive statistics on orders, visits, overall performance (scored out of 100), peer ranking, and performance percentiles. The user interface for user management was updated to include advanced search and filtering capabilities.
2.  **Professional Colored Clinic Categorization**: Clinics are now automatically categorized and visually represented with colors:
    *   ðŸŸ¢ **Green**: For new clinics with no outstanding debt.
    *   ðŸŸ¡ **Gold**: For featured or high-revenue clinics.
    *   ðŸ”´ **Red**: For clinics with significant overdue debt (specifically, over 1000 EGP).
    This classification is intelligent and automatic but allows for manual overrides.
3.  **Comprehensive Clinic Mini-Profile**: A detailed modal mini-profile for clinics was introduced. This profile displays:
    *   Full clinic statistics (visits, orders, debt).
    *   Information about the responsible user (name, role, visit count).
    *   Summaries of the last 5 visits and last 5 orders, with direct links to full details in their respective sections.
4.  **Integrated Debt System**: A robust system for managing invoices and debt was implemented.
    *   All new invoices are now initially marked as  (debt).
    *   The accounting department can manage and mark invoices as paid, updating the clinic's financial status.
    *   This system is directly linked to the colored clinic categorization, automatically updating a clinic's color based on its debt status.
    *   Detailed transaction records are maintained.

Technically, this involved adding new data models in  for clinics (with classification fields), invoices, and payment records. Numerous new FastAPI endpoints were created for user performance data, clinic statistics, and invoice management. On the frontend,  was extensively modified to incorporate new React components such as , , and , along with updated routing and state management to display these features. A utility script () was also created and run to generate sample debt data for testing. The AI engineer reported the completion with high confidence, providing a final screenshot of the system.

<optional_next_step>
The next step is to begin implementing the newly requested features starting with backend updates, including order warnings for indebted clinics, manager inclusion in visit logs, restricted rep profile views, and the detailed movement log system.
