The AI engineer successfully transitioned an application from 0 to 1, delivering core modules for user, clinic, product, warehouse, visit, activity, and order management, alongside dynamic themes and global search. Despite repeated assertions of completion, the user frequently reported persistent UI/UX bugs and functional deficiencies. The AI engineer adopted a phased approach: first, addressing fundamental UI issues (pop-ups, header, themes); second, developing a new Debt and Collection module; and third, enhancing the Admin Dashboard. While significant progress was made and many features were implemented (e.g., new visit form, enhanced user cards, improved clinic registration, order detail enhancements), testing revealed lingering UI inconsistencies and incomplete functionalities. The current work focuses on resolving recent user-reported issues on the Dashboard, including header display, theme selector functionality, user profile access, and the linking of dashboard statistics and quick actions to their respective modules.

The EP Group System is an enterprise application designed for multi-level user and warehouse management, supporting Arabic/English localization, dynamic themes, global search, CRUD operations, invoicing, hierarchical order approval, and monthly planning. Key features developed include a modular architecture with centralized configuration, dynamic UI/UX enhancements like multiple themes (Modern, Minimal, Glassy, Dark, White, Neon) and a glassy header. Core modules encompass User Management (detailed performance cards, edit/delete), Clinic Management (merged tabs, interactive map, responsible person tracking), Product Management (simplified table, add/delete), Warehouse Management (inventory refactoring underway), Daily Login Records (detailed logs for admin), Activity & GPS Tracking, and Visit Management (new visit option, comprehensive data display with GPS). Order Management now hides prices for non-accountants and adds clinic/sales rep cards. Authentication includes biometric/selfie login for medical reps. The user reported persistent bugs related to header, theme selection, pop-ups, and non-functional dashboard elements. New requirements include a full Debt and Collection module and comprehensive Admin Dashboard enhancements.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary, the previous AI engineer had just completed work on the **Warehouse Management** section, which encountered navigation issues during testing. Following this, the user provided extensive feedback on persistent issues across the application, outlining a phased plan for further development.

The AI engineer started with **Phase One: Basic Fixes** (Pop-ups, Header, Themes), making edits to  and  to improve modal and header styling.

Then, the **Phase Two: Debt and Collection Section** was initiated. Backend models (, ) and routes (, integrated into ) were created and tested, achieving 100% success for backend APIs. Frontend configuration () and a new component () were also set up, and the  was updated to include it.

Next, the user requested to proceed with **Phase Three: Admin Dashboard improvements** before completing frontend testing for Phase Two. The  component was significantly refactored to include enhanced metrics, filters, quick actions, and dynamic activity logs. During this, an issue with  was resolved by moving it to the correct scope.

The current work focuses on addressing a new set of critical bugs reported by the user after the comprehensive testing:
1.  **Header Issues**: The company logo and name were invisible, and the theme menu was unclickable due to layering issues. Edits were made to  to adjust CSS and z-index for the header and theme menu elements.
2.  **User Profile Access**: The right-side menu lacked accessible profile information and settings. Two new components,  and , were created.  was updated to map these, and  was modified to integrate these new components into the sidebar, ensuring they can be displayed.
3.  **Dashboard Icon Linking**: The dashboard metrics (e.g., Total Reps, Clinics) were not linked to their respective management pages. The AI engineer has started modifying  to add  handlers to  components, passing  to navigate to relevant sections. The most recent action was updating the  file to include  as a prop and use it for the statistics cards, but this task is still in progress.
