The trajectory outlines the previous AI engineer's work on an enterprise application, starting from an MVP state. The initial focus was on addressing persistent UI/UX bugs, particularly related to the application header and theme consistency, which required multiple iterations despite the engineer's declarations of completion. A significant part of the recent work involved a complete redesign of the header, implementing dynamic elements, advanced search, expanded theme options, and user profile management. Following this, the user shifted priorities to core system functionalities and data integrity. The AI engineer then rigorously audited and fixed database relationships and data consistency, specifically enhancing the dashboard data. Subsequently, the AI engineer commenced implementing new major features requested by the user: an Advanced Notification System and an Integrated CRM System, both of which were successfully completed and tested. The work concludes with the AI engineer in the process of building the Advanced Analytics System, having completed its backend setup and initial frontend component integration.

<product_requirements>
The EP Group System is an enterprise application designed for multi-level user and warehouse management, supporting Arabic/English localization, dynamic themes, global search, CRUD operations, invoicing, hierarchical order approval, and monthly planning. Key features include user management (detailed performance cards, full user card restoration with added financial and activity statistics), clinic management (interactive map, admin approval tracking, responsible person details, medical specialization removal), product and warehouse management (inventory, product tables, role-based access), daily login records, activity tracking (detailed modal), and visit management (comprehensive data, non-editable voice-to-text notes). Order management requires hidden prices for non-accountants. Authentication includes biometric/selfie login.

Recent requirements and fixes included:
1.  **Debt and Collection Module & Admin Dashboard Enhancements**: Linking stats, quick actions, dynamic activities, PDF export.
2.  **Persistent Bug Fixes**: Header display issues (logo/name, theme menu z-index, positioning), non-functional dashboard elements (date filters, quick actions), user profile access, pop-up improvements, full responsiveness.
3.  **System Logo**: Display on login, preloader, user profile.
4.  **Complete Header Redesign**: Company logo/name, advanced search, 7 themes, language selector, user mini-profile with logout.
5.  **Theme Re-evaluation and Fixes**: Address jarring colors (Golden, Neon), ensure consistent contrast and aesthetics across all 7 themes.
6.  **Database Consistency and Interlinking**: Verify all database connections, ensure logical relationships between entities, and guarantee data integrity (e.g., all numbers have a basis, records are not orphaned, relationships are strong and logical).
7.  **New Feature Implementations (prioritized by user)**:
    *   Advanced Notification System (real-time, categorized, with backend APIs and frontend UI).
    *   Integrated CRM System (client management, interaction tracking, task management, performance analytics).
    *   Advanced Analytics System (interactive charts, comprehensive reports, PDF/Excel export).
    *   (Initially requested but de-prioritized): AI System (LLM integration), Advanced Mobile App features.

<current_work>
Immediately prior to this summary, the previous AI engineer was actively engaged in developing the **Advanced Analytics System**. This is the third major feature being implemented in a sequence that included the Advanced Notification System and the Integrated CRM System.

The work on the Advanced Analytics System so far has encompassed:
1.  **Backend Models Creation**: New Pydantic models for analytics data structures were created in .
2.  **Backend Service Creation**: The business logic for generating and processing analytics was defined in a new service file: .
3.  **Backend API Routes Creation**: Dedicated API endpoints for analytics functionalities were created in , enabling the frontend to request various reports and data.
4.  **Backend Integration**: The newly created analytics routes were successfully included into the main FastAPI application server, , ensuring they are accessible to the frontend.
5.  **Frontend Component Creation**: An initial frontend component, , was created to house the UI for the analytics dashboard.
6.  **Frontend Integration**: This new  component was added to the main application's routing and navigation within , making it accessible via the application's interface.

The current state is that the backend infrastructure for analytics is set up, and the frontend component has been created and integrated into the main application structure. The implementation of the interactive charts, detailed reports, and PDF/Excel export functionalities within the frontend component is the next logical phase.
