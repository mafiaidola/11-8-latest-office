The AI engineer's trajectory reveals an iterative and often challenging development process, primarily centered on bug fixing and enhancing a React/FastAPI/MongoDB application. The work has been characterized by recurring UI/UX issues, particularly concerning theme consistency, readability, modal positioning, and general layout (overlapping sections), requiring multiple cycles of fixes and direct user feedback. Concurrently, the engineer also implemented significant functional features such as interactive activity tracking, enhanced visit management with export, improved dashboard time filters, and integrated analytics into Clinics and Warehouses modules. The recent focus has been on addressing critical UI bugs reported by the user, including header, theme, modal, and text formatting problems, followed by a pivot to fixing non-functional frontend elements (like add user and create order buttons) and then backend CRUD operations, which were found to be faulty. The trajectory concludes with the engineer actively debugging backend API issues related to CRUD operations for various modules.

The EP Group System is an enterprise application designed for multi-level user and warehouse management. It features Arabic/English localization, dynamic themes, global search, comprehensive CRUD operations, invoicing, and a hierarchical order approval system. Key functionalities include user performance tracking, clinic management with interactive maps, product/warehouse inventory, activity tracking, and visit management with voice-to-text notes. Security features hide order prices from non-accountants and support biometric/selfie login.

Recent implementations by the AI engineer include: a Debt and Collection Module, Admin Dashboard Enhancements (linking stats, quick actions, PDF export), various UI bug fixes (header, dashboard responsiveness, pop-ups, system logo, theme consistency, font), Database Consistency improvements, and new systems for Advanced Notifications, Integrated CRM, and Advanced Analytics. User management now includes comprehensive editing and detailed profiles, alongside system cleanup for streamlined components. Tracking and Admin Dashboard features have been enhanced with interactive maps and refined time filters/sections, respectively. Visit Management has been improved and restricted to admin access.

Despite these efforts, significant, recurring UI/UX issues persist, including overlapping sections, inconsistent themes, unreadable text, non-functional header menus and pop-up modals (appearing off-screen), and text overflow. Additionally, several critical backend and frontend functionalities are reported broken, such as global search, add user and create order buttons, issues with editing/deleting clinics and warehouse products, and errors in area management. A major requirement is to integrate debt/collection with accounting/invoicing, ensuring robust data linking and Arabic language support for print/export functions with the system logo. Dashboard numbers must be accurate (showing zero if no data), and quick actions need proper formatting. A new section for Recent Activities is required on the dashboard, split into Representative Visits and Collection with detailed records. The overarching goal is a professional, responsive, and fully functional system with stable themes and header.

<current_work>
Immediately prior to this summary, the AI engineer was deep into fixing critical backend issues that had surfaced after previous UI/UX and frontend button fixes. The user's extensive bug report (Chat 150) highlighted that while some frontend elements like the Add User and Create Order modals were built, the backend APIs supporting core CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) for various modules were failing, specifically returning HTTP 500 errors.

The AI engineer's actions focused on diagnosing and resolving these backend issues:
1.  **Backend Testing**: Initiated a comprehensive backend test (Chat 197), which revealed only 38.9% success, pinpointing critical API malfunctions.
2.  **API Identification**: Began by inspecting  to locate problematic endpoints, specifically focusing on Clinic and Debt-related APIs. It was discovered that a DELETE endpoint for clinics was entirely missing (Chat 212).
3.  **Initial Backend Fixes**:
    *   Added the missing DELETE endpoint for clinics to  (Chat 215).
    *   Attempted to add missing Debt APIs and related requirements, ensuring they were correctly included before the main router definitions (Chat 221-222).
4.  **Troubleshooting Session**: After further backend testing showed a 57.1% success rate but persistent HTTP 500 errors for PUT/DELETE, the  was engaged (Chat 226).
5.  **Critical Backend Bug Fix**: The  identified a crucial error: the code was incorrectly accessing user properties using  instead of . The engineer systematically applied this fix across multiple relevant sections in  (Chat 228, 231, 233, 235, 237).
6.  **Cleanup**: Deleted a duplicate areas endpoint discovered by the troubleshooter (Chat 241).
7.  **Current Focus**: The last action in the trajectory was the engineer preparing to fix the  (Chat 245), indicating that backend CRUD operations are still the immediate priority, specifically focusing on a particular endpoint identified as problematic.
