The previous AI engineer initiated the development of a full-stack enterprise application from scratch, moving from a monolithic structure to a modular React frontend with a FastAPI backend. This involved extensive refactoring, centralizing configuration in , and creating dynamic components. Key efforts included implementing dynamic themes, integrating global search, and adding new modules like Accounting, Visits, and Activity Tracking. Despite iterative bug fixes and feature enhancements, particularly in product, clinic, and user management, the project faced persistent issues. The AI engineer frequently claimed successful completion of tasks, only for the user to report re-emerging or unresolved bugs, indicating a discrepancy between implemented fixes and desired functionality. The trajectory concludes with the user explicitly re-stating many previously fixed issues, specifically regarding theme functionality, header styling, and core module functionality, to which the AI engineer has just begun to respond.

<product_requirements>
The EP Group System is an enterprise application for multi-level user and warehouse management, supporting Arabic/English localization, dynamic themes, global search, CRUD operations, invoicing, hierarchical order approval, and monthly planning. Key requirements included:
1.  **Modular Architecture:** Centralized control points and logical organization to prevent regressions.
2.  **UI/UX:** Dynamic themes (Modern, Minimal, Glassy, Dark, White, and a newly requested Neon theme with orange/dark neon colors), improved header formatting (glassy on scroll), centered/less transparent pop-ups, comprehensive global search (invoice, doctor, clinic, user), and interactive icon-based dropdowns for clinic registration.
3.  **Core Modules:**
    *   **User Management:** Consolidated roles, Lines Management grid, colored user cards, bulk actions, hierarchical roles, region/line linking, profile viewing. A highly detailed performance card showing approved orders, debts, remaining debts, approved clinics, visits (weekly/monthly/yearly), direct manager, line, and region. Add/delete user buttons on the user card.
    *   **Clinic Management:** Merging tabs, interactive classification/credit, hiding sensitive info, draggable Google Maps integration (with GPS capture for admin), speech-to-text for visit registration, admin view for registration source/details.
    *   **Product Management:** Simplified table, unit dropdowns, line linking, price visibility, functional add/delete (a recurring bug).
    *   **Warehouse Management:** Dashboard buttons, consistent inventory, functional orders/movement log.
    *   **Daily Login Records:** Remove duplicates, provide detailed logs (IP, location on Google Map, device type, biometric/selfie status) for admin only.
4.  **Activity & GPS Tracking:** Comprehensive logging for all rep/manager actions (orders, visits, debts) with date, time, and GPS location on Google Maps, visible only to admin.
5.  **Visit Management:** A new Visit option for medical reps. All visit data (clinic, managers, effectiveness, order status, direct manager) for admin (with GPS) and managers (without GPS) in a visit log.
6.  **Representative Dashboard:** Redesign to show Week/Month/Year selector, aggregated stats (total visits, approved clinics, orders, debts, unvisited clinics), quick actions (New Visit, New Clinic Registration, Create Debt/Order, System Support Request), and recent activity specific to the rep.
7.  **Authentication:** Biometric/selfie login for medical reps.
8.  **Planning System:** A comprehensive planning system for admins, managers, and users.

<pending_tasks>
-   **Themes:** Fully fix the theme system to globally apply chosen styles (including Neon), not just icons. Implement header transformation (glassy effect) on scroll.
-   **User Management:** Detail the User Performance Card (approved orders, debts, remaining debts, approved clinics, visits (week/month/year), direct manager, line, region). Implement Edit and Delete buttons on the user card.
-   **Product Management:** Fix Add Product and Delete Product functionalities.
-   **Visit Functionality (Reps):** Create a new Visit option for reps with specific form fields (clinic selection, multi-manager selection, visit effectiveness, order status).
-   **Activity & GPS Tracking:** Ensure all rep/manager movements (orders, visits, debts) are logged with GPS for admin, and visit details without GPS for managers in a visit log.
-   **Visit & Login Management (Admin):** Make these sections admin-only. Detail login logs (IP, location on map, device, biometric/selfie) and ensure visit logs are comprehensive and error-free.
-   **Representative Dashboard Redesign:** Remove icon row, implement Week/Month/Year selector for aggregated stats (visits, approved clinics, orders, debts, unvisited clinics). Add quick action buttons (New Visit, New Clinic Registration, Create Debt/Order, Support). Refine recent activity section to be rep-specific.

<current_work>
Immediately prior to this summary, the previous AI engineer had just concluded a testing phase, claiming 100% completion of previously requested updates. However, the user provided extensive new feedback (Chat Message 295), indicating that many critical issues persist and new feature requirements have been specified.

The user's latest report explicitly states that:
1.  **Themes are still not working correctly**, merely acting as useless icons and not changing the entire page's appearance. The header also needs professional reformatting and a glassy effect on scroll.
2.  **User Management** requires a more detailed performance card with specific metrics (orders, debts, visits) and Edit / Delete buttons directly on the card.
3.  **Product Management** has regressed, as adding and deleting products is currently non-functional.
4.  New **Visit option** with detailed logging requirements (GPS for admin, specific form fields) and **Visit & Login Management** for admin-only viewing with comprehensive logs are critical.
5.  **Representative Dashboard** needs a complete redesign.

The AI engineer's immediate response (Chat Message 296) was to acknowledge these new requirements and prioritize fixing the themes and header. The last action (Chat Message 297/298) shows the AI engineer attempting to address the theme issue, noting a potential discrepancy in the file structure for  and suggesting a rewrite or careful re-evaluation of the file content to ensure themes apply universally. This suggests the engineer is in the very initial stages of re-addressing the theme and header issues based on the *latest* user feedback, which contradicts the previous 100% complete claim.

<optional_next_step>
My next step is to comprehensively fix the theme system and header reformatting in  and  as per the user's latest explicit feedback.
