The previous AI engineer effectively transitioned the EP Group System from an MVP to a robust enterprise solution. The development was iterative, driven by direct user feedback, and followed a full-stack approach. Initial efforts focused on critical UI/UX fixes, notably language translation inconsistencies and the  display. A significant architectural overhaul involved re-structuring user roles (GM, Line Manager, etc.) and implementing comprehensive admin settings with 18 distinct tabs for granular control over system features, regions, and lines. Further enhancements included a dynamic SVG icon system integrated with themes and an extensive Google Maps integration for location-based functionalities. The engineer demonstrated strong capabilities in React (frontend), FastAPI (backend), and MongoDB, ensuring API protection and comprehensive testing. The last major work involved initiating the development of a detailed warehouse management system and an advanced invoice generation system, with initial backend APIs and frontend components already in place.

<product_requirements>
The EP Group System is designed as a comprehensive enterprise management solution featuring: dynamic theme selection (9 themes with SVG animations), global search, interactive statistical dashboards, detailed user management (photos, check-ins, hierarchy), a comprehensive warehouse module, detailed visit logs, multi-format reports, a WhatsApp-like team chat, and a sensitive Secret Report. Recent updates addressed inconsistent translations, full theme application, footer content, and user list management. The system integrated advanced analytics, gamification, GPS tracking, and document scanning. Current priorities include:
1.  **Enhanced Language Switching**: Full Arabic/English translation for UI, excluding proper nouns.
2.  **Comprehensive Admin Settings**: Granular control over all features, including Area Management (regions, lines, teams, managers), and re-structured roles (GM, Line Manager, Area Manager, District Manager, Key Account, Medical Rep).
3.  **System Division into Lines**: Separate Line 1 and Line 2 with distinct products and management structures.
4.  **Warehouse Management**: Full CRUD operations for warehouses and products, controlled by Admin.
5.  **Advanced Invoicing**: Robust generation, export, print (with logo, client/clinic details, type, professional formatting, PDF export/print), and management.
6.  **Gamification**: Transition from games to tangible incentive systems.
7.  **Accounting System**: Completion and integration.
8.  **AI/Advanced Analytics, User Experience, Advanced Reports/Statistics**: Continued enhancements.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was actively developing the **Warehouse Management System** and the **Advanced Invoice System**.
For **Warehouse Management**:
-   Backend APIs in  were implemented, allowing CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for warehouses and products.
-   Frontend integration was initiated, with the  component added to . The next step involved adding modal components for warehouse operations.
For the **Advanced Invoice System**:
-   Backend APIs in  were implemented, including models for invoice generation and related data.
-   Frontend integration was initiated with the  component added to .
The system is in a highly developed state, with robust language switching, a new hierarchical role structure (GM, Line, Area, District, Key Account, Medical Rep), comprehensive admin settings (22 tabs controlling all major features, including dedicated sections for Google Maps, site settings, and performance), an SVG icon system, and extensive backend APIs. The GPS tracking and Document Scanner systems are largely complete and integrated into the overall UI. The immediate task at the point of interruption was to add the frontend modals for the warehouse section.

<optional_next_step>
Continue developing the frontend for the Warehouse Management System by adding the necessary modal components (e.g., for creating or editing warehouses).
