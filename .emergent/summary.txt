The previous AI engineer focused on iterative development, initially fixing critical bugs in a React/FastAPI/MongoDB application, particularly related to UI stability, login, and data consistency across User, Clinic, Product, Warehouse, and Daily Login Records modules. This involved extensive debugging on both frontend (, ) and backend (, , ). A recurring pattern involved resolving reported issues, only for new or regressed bugs to emerge, leading to a deep dive into frontend rendering and architectural structure. The most recent phase involved a significant refactoring of the frontend into a modular system with centralized configuration and component management, replacing the monolithic . This refactoring aimed to address user requests for code organization and single control points. However, the work is currently in a state where the new architecture is in place, but several key functional areas display under development messages, indicating incomplete migration or new regressions.

<product_requirements>
The EP Group System is an enterprise application for multi-level user and warehouse management, supporting Arabic/English localization, dynamic themes, global search, CRUD, invoicing, hierarchical order approval, and monthly planning. Initial development focused on bug fixes and core module enhancements across user management, region-specific stock, automated invoicing, mini-profiles, enhanced location tracking, and UI redesigns. Recent development focuses on:
*   **User Management**: Consolidate roles, Lines Management grid, colored user cards, bulk actions, hierarchical roles, correct region/line linking, and working profile viewing.
*   **Clinic Management**: Merge duplicate tabs, new interactive classification and credit status system, hide sensitive info, draggable map. Visit registration needs speech-to-text. Admin view needs registration source, advanced details (orders, debt, region, lines).
*   **Product Management**: Overhaul includes removing search/filter, specific unit dropdowns, linking lines, removing tiered pricing/cashback, controlling price visibility, and simplifying product table. Add/delete functionality must work and be linked across the site.
*   **Warehouse Management**: Dashboard Add/Edit/View buttons, consistent Inventory products linked to main list, functional Orders tab buttons allowing Admin to create orders (registering debt), and Movement Log buttons connected to the database.
*   **Daily Login Records**: Remove duplicate sections.
*   **General Bugs & Enhancements**: Resolve dashboard bugs, lines management, permissions, gamification, GPS, planning, clinic stability, and login consistency.
*   **Architectural Refinement (New)**: Centralized code structure, single control points for sections, logical organization, and ensuring refactoring doesn't break existing functionality.

*   ****:
    *   **Importance**: Now serves as the main entry point for the refactored React application. It uses , , and  to dynamically render UI based on user roles and active tabs.
    *   **Changes Made**: Overhauled from a monolithic file to a lean orchestrator. It imports and utilizes the newly created core components and configuration to manage routing and component display. Includes the  definition, moved here to address its previous absence.
*   ****:
    *   **Importance**: Contains the original, large codebase of the  before the refactoring. It acts as a source for migrating functionalities into the new modular structure.
    *   **Changes Made**: This file was created by copying the content of the old  to enable a clean rewrite.
*   ****:
    *   **Importance**: **NEWLY CREATED**. Centralizes roles, system tabs, their permissions, and mapping to components. Essential for modular navigation and access control.
    *   **Changes Made**: Defines  hierarchy,  with path, icon, names, permissions, and component names for dynamic rendering.
*   ****:
    *   **Importance**: **NEWLY CREATED**. Renders the application's navigation menu dynamically based on  and user roles, managing the active tab state.
    *   **Changes Made**: Implements the side navigation bar, displaying tabs relevant to the logged-in user's role.
*   ****:
    *   **Importance**: **NEWLY CREATED**. A core component that receives the active tab and component map to render the correct functional component, promoting a modular architecture.
    *   **Changes Made**: Dynamically renders components by matching the active tab to a component name, facilitating a plug-and-play structure for UI sections. Many components initially render This component is under development... placeholders.
*   ****:
    *   **Importance**: **NEWLY CREATED**. Centralizes all hardcoded strings for multi-language support (English and Arabic).
    *   **Changes Made**: Contains a structured object for all translatable strings used across the application.
*   ** (e.g., , , , , , , , , )**:
    *   **Importance**: **NEWLY CREATED/MOVED**. These are the individual functional components that were extracted or are being extracted from the monolithic  to fit the new modular structure.
    *   **Changes Made**: Initial versions are often simplified, showing under development messages. Over time, the original logic from  is being migrated into these dedicated files. The Product Management, Clinic Management, Geographic Management, and System Management components are currently displaying under development messages.

*   ****:
    *   **Importance**: Main FastAPI application entry point, integrating all backend routes and models.
    *   **Changes Made**: Ensures all necessary route modules are included. Minor bug fixes implemented for clinic creation logic, duplicate endpoints, and product price visibility.
*   ****:
    *   **Importance**: Defines Pydantic models for geographical entities like  and .
    *   **Changes Made**: Newly created to support geographic features.

<current_work>
Immediately prior to this summary, the AI engineer completed a major frontend architectural refactoring. The monolithic  was replaced with a new modular structure, where  now acts as an orchestrator, utilizing new files like  (for centralized configuration, roles, and tab mappings),  (for dynamic navigation), and  (for rendering active components based on configuration).  was created to house the original, unrefactored  content.

Key components (, , , , ) were being migrated into their own dedicated files under , though some were initially placeholders. A bug with  not appearing for the  user was investigated and fixed by adjusting role-based access logic (allowing admin to register clinics and creating a test medical rep user). The  was identified as missing and was later added to  (after being incorrectly placed and then corrected).

The comprehensive backend testing reported 100% success. After frontend infrastructure testing and a comprehensive report on the 15 tabs of the new system, the user reported new critical issues. Currently, the system's new architecture is loading, but several core sections, including **Product Management**, **Clinic Management**, **Geographic Management (Lines, Areas, Location Tracking)**, and **System Management**, are displaying This component is under development... messages, and product add/delete functionality is broken, indicating incomplete migration or regressions in the new modular setup.

<optional_next_step>
Investigate and fix the reported bug in Product Management (add/delete functionality) and then address the component under development placeholders for Clinic, Geographic, and System Management sections by migrating their full functionality.
