The AI engineer's work involved an intense, iterative process of bug fixing and feature enhancement on an existing React/FastAPI/MongoDB application. The primary focus areas evolved from foundational login and UI issues to major functional modules like User Management, Clinic Registration, and Product Management, alongside the integration of Lines and Areas. A significant portion of the trajectory details the persistent and re-occurring login problems on the frontend, which often blocked further testing. The engineer demonstrated strong debugging skills, applying fixes to both frontend (App.js, craco.config.js) and backend (server.py, route logic) to resolve data inconsistencies, API misconfigurations, and UI rendering issues. Despite several 100% success reports, user feedback consistently brought back unresolved or new issues, particularly concerning Product Management (add/delete) and the stability of frontend login/rendering. The work concludes with a re-reported bug regarding product addition and deletion.

The EP Group System is an enterprise application for multi-level user and warehouse management, supporting Arabic/English localization, dynamic themes, and global search. It features CRUD operations, advanced invoicing, hierarchical order approval, and monthly planning. Initial development focused on bug fixes and core module enhancements including user management, region-specific stock, automated invoicing, mini-profiles, enhanced location tracking, and UI redesigns.

Recent development focuses on:
*   **User Management:** Consolidate roles, implement Lines Management in Work Information as a grid with icons, link to Lines/Areas, enhance user list display with role-based colored cards, and add bulk actions.
*   **Clinic Management:**
    *   **Clinic Registration:** Merge duplicate tabs, implement new interactive clinic classification (A Star to D) and a credit status system (Green/Yellow/Red), hide sensitive info from delegates, and ensure precise, draggable map functionality without errors.
    *   **Clinic Visit Registration:** Add speech-to-text for voice notes to an additional notes field.
*   **General Bugs & Enhancements:** Resolve dashboard bugs (non-functional, missing demo users, broken themes), fix lines management (adding lines/products), permissions, gamification data, GPS, planning, and clinics. Overhaul Product Management (remove search/filter, specific unit dropdowns, link lines, remove tiered pricing/cashback, control price visibility, simplified product table).

<pending_tasks>
-   Complete functions for adding new Lines and Areas (e.g., detailed forms, linking to managers/areas).
-   Improve system stability, particularly for frontend behavior and login consistency.
-   Enhance data display (loading states, success/failure messages, delete confirmations, responsive design).
-   User-reported bug: Product Management (cannot add or delete products, perceived as unlinked to the system).

Immediately prior to this summary, the AI engineer was engaged in a comprehensive final testing phase after implementing several suggested simple improvements aimed at reaching 100% success rate. These improvements included adding Daily Login Records and Admin Clinics Management sections to the navigation, and refining existing Lines and Areas Management functionalities.

Despite these efforts, the testing revealed persistent frontend stability issues, specifically with login, which recurred multiple times throughout the trajectory. Once login was temporarily stable, the focus shifted to Product Management, which was reported to be functioning well except for admin price visibility (which was then fixed).

However, the very last user message explicitly states: يوجد مشاكل فى قسم المنتجات ، لا استطيع الحذف او الاضافه واعتقد انها غير مرتبطه بالنظام ، برجاء المراجعة (There are issues in the products section, I cannot delete or add, and I believe it is not linked to the system, please review). This indicates that the Product Management add/delete functionality, which was previously thought to be working, is again broken or was never fully functional. The AI engineer has just acknowledged this critical bug report and has initiated the investigation into the backend APIs for products to address the add/delete issues.

<optional_next_step>
Investigate and fix the Product Management backend APIs to resolve the inability to add or delete products.
