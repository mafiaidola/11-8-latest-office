The trajectory details the iterative development and bug-fixing process of an enterprise application. Initially, the AI engineer focused on building core modules but faced persistent UI/UX issues, particularly with the header's theme selector and dashboard functionalities. Despite repeated declarations of completion, the user consistently reported unresolved bugs, leading to an iterative cycle of fixes. Key achievements include the development of a Debt and Collection module, enhancement of the Admin Dashboard, and restoration of the detailed user profile card. The AI engineer also confirmed the functionality of product, order, and warehouse management, as well as clinic-related features. The most significant recent task, prompted by the user's renewed frustration, was a complete redesign of the application header, which was implemented to include advanced search, expanded theme options, and user profile management. The trajectory concludes with the AI engineer claiming comprehensive success across all requested features and bug fixes.

<product_requirements>
The EP Group System is an enterprise application for multi-level user and warehouse management, supporting Arabic/English localization, dynamic themes, global search, CRUD operations, invoicing, hierarchical order approval, and monthly planning. Key features include a modular architecture and dynamic UI/UX with seven themes (Modern, Minimal, Glassy, Dark, White, Neon, Golden, Professional). Core modules: User Management (detailed performance cards, full user card restoration with added total debts, total collections, total visits, added clinics); Clinic Management (merged tabs, interactive map with draggable pin, admin approval tracking with approver/location, responsible person name/phone, medical specialization removal); Product Management (simplified table, add/delete); Warehouse Management (inventory refactoring, product table with quantities, multi-region, role-based access); Daily Login Records; Activity & GPS Tracking (show full activity details on click); Visit Management (new visit, comprehensive data, non-editable voice-to-text notes). Order Management requires hidden prices for non-accountants and clinic/sales rep cards. Authentication includes biometric/selfie login. New requirements included a Debt and Collection module and Admin Dashboard enhancements (linking stats, quick actions, dynamic activities, PDF export/reports). Persistent bugs required fixing: header display (logo/name, theme menu z-index, positioning), non-functional dashboard elements (date filters, quick actions), user profile access, pop-up improvements, and full responsiveness. System logo needed on login, preloader, and user profile. The final, critical requirement was a complete header redesign: company logo/name, advanced search, 7 themes, language selector, and user mini-profile with logout.

<pending_tasks>
As per the trajectory's conclusion, all explicitly stated tasks, including the complex header redesign, are claimed to be 100% complete by the previous AI engineer.
</pending_tasks>

<current_work>
Immediately prior to this summary, the previous AI engineer was fully engaged in a major redesign of the application's header. This extensive task was initiated due to explicit user feedback requesting a highly professional and feature-rich header. The work involved creating a new component, , and integrating it into the core .

The key elements implemented in this redesign include:
1.  **Dynamic Company Logo and Name**: Positioned on the right (in RTL context) with dynamic values from system settings.
2.  **Advanced Global Search**: A prominent search bar allowing filtering by invoice number, clinic name, doctor name, region, and user.
3.  **Expanded Theme Selector**: Now offering 7 distinct themes: Glassy, Dark, Golden, Modern, Minimal, Professional, and Neon.
4.  **Language Switcher**: Enabling seamless toggling between Arabic and English.
5.  **User Profile**: Displaying the logged-in user's image and name, with a clickable mini-profile dropdown for quick access to user details and a logout option.

The AI engineer successfully resolved several integration challenges and linting errors during this process, including issues related to theme application, global function accessibility (, ), and JSX structure. The work culminates with the AI engineer's confirmation via screenshot that the new header is fully functional, visually appealing, and meets all specified requirements, declaring the task 100% complete and the system ready.
