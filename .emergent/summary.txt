The previous AI engineer focused on refactoring a monolithic React frontend () into a modular architecture, centralizing configuration in  and using  and . This involved migrating functionalities into dedicated components, though many were initially placeholders. Key technical issues addressed included UI stability, login, data consistency, and API URL fixes in components. Despite backend stability, frontend development was iterative, with bugs (e.g., product add/delete, under development messages) appearing or regressing after refactoring. The AI engineer attempted to implement themes, improve global search, centralize modal styling, and integrate new modules like Accounting, Visits, and Activity Tracking. The process was heavily driven by detailed user feedback, often in Arabic, leading to continuous bug fixing and feature enhancements. The current state is mid-fix for persistent parsing errors in , identified after attempting to integrate a new Activity Tracking module, reflecting ongoing challenges in establishing a stable, fully functional modular frontend.

The EP Group System is an enterprise application for multi-level user and warehouse management. It supports Arabic/English localization, dynamic themes, global search, CRUD operations, invoicing, hierarchical order approval, and monthly planning. Initial work concentrated on fixing core bugs and enhancing user, product, warehouse, and daily login modules. Recent focus shifted to refining user management (consolidated roles, Lines Management grid, colored user cards, bulk actions, hierarchical roles, region/line linking, profile viewing), clinic management (merging tabs, interactive classification/credit, hiding sensitive info, draggable map, speech-to-text for visit registration, admin view for registration source/details), product management (simplified table, unit dropdowns, line linking, price visibility, working add/delete), warehouse management (dashboard buttons, consistent inventory, functional orders/movement log), and daily login records (remove duplicates). A critical new requirement was architectural refinement for centralized code structure, single control points, logical organization, and ensuring no regressions. The user explicitly requested 5 themes (modern, minimal, glassy, dark, white), comprehensive frontend testing, re-enabled global search by invoice/doctor/clinic/user, centered/less transparent pop-ups, restoration of Google Maps in clinic registration, activity tracking for registrations/orders/visits with GPS/timestamps, a dedicated admin tracking section, biometric/selfie login for medical reps, and a planning system.

**Key Files and Changes:**

*   ****: Refactored as the main orchestrator, dynamically rendering UI via , , and . The  definition was moved here. Recent edits involved fixing theme application logic and passing  for global search functionality.
*   ****: Original  content, kept for reference during migration. No changes were made to this file during the recent trajectory.
*   ****: **NEWLY CREATED**. Centralizes roles, tabs, permissions, and component mappings. Critical for modularity and access control. It has undergone multiple edits to add new tabs (Accounting, Visits, Activity Tracking) but has also been the source of persistent  issues, leading to its full recreation by the AI engineer in the last steps.
*   ****: **NEWLY CREATED**. Renders the dynamic navigation menu based on  and user roles. No specific changes were noted in the trajectory, but it relies on .
*   ****: **NEWLY CREATED**. Dynamically renders components by matching active tabs to components. Many components initially render under development placeholders. Updated to include , , and .
*   ****: **NEWLY CREATED**. Centralizes translatable strings. No direct changes observed.
*   ** (various)**:
    *   ****: Initially displayed under development. Fixed API URL and needs comprehensive functionality (add/delete, details button, price visibility).
    *   ****: Initially displayed under development. Recreated based on  pattern and later updated to include .
    *   ****: Fixed API URL issue.
    *   ** (under Geographic)**: Created as a placeholder.
    *   ****: Created as a placeholder.
    *   ****: **NEWLY CREATED**. Added to integrate financial features.
    *   ****: **NEWLY CREATED**. Added for visit registration and tracking.
    *   ****: **NEWLY CREATED**. To display detailed clinic information.
    *   ****: **NEWLY CREATED**. For activity and GPS tracking.
*   ****: Main FastAPI entry. Minor bug fixes for clinic creation, duplicate endpoints, and product price visibility.
*   ** & **: Created for geographic features, confirmed functional.
*   ****: Created to fix clinic registration data reception.
*   ****: Defines global styles. Significant changes made to implement 5 dynamic themes, improve header styling, and adjust modal transparency. Repeatedly required fixes due to syntax errors.
*   ****: Modified for proxy settings to backend URL.
*   ****: Modified to include theme selection, global search input, and overall styling improvements.
*   ****: Updated to handle broader search functionality (invoice, doctor, clinic, user) and receive  prop.

<pending_tasks>
-   **Theme System**: Fully fix and verify the 5 dynamic themes functionality across the application.
-   **Header Formatting**: Complete the styling and functionality of the header, including language selection and global search button.
-   **Global Search Enhancement**: Implement the comprehensive global search to include invoice numbers, doctor names, clinic names, and user names, ensuring results are actionable.
-   **Modal Styling**: Ensure all pop-up modals are consistently centered and have appropriate, reduced transparency.
-   **Google Maps Integration**: Restore and verify Google Maps functionality, specifically in clinic registration and any other relevant pages.
-   **Activity & GPS Tracking**: Implement detailed logging of actions (clinic registration, visits, orders) including user, timestamp, and GPS location. Create the dedicated Tracking section for admin to view this data.
-   **Product Management Functionality**: Modify the product delete button to perform actual deletion, not just activation/deactivation. Add a product details button.
-   **Clinic Registration UI**: Update dropdowns in clinic registration to be more interactive and modern, potentially using SVG icons.
-   **Clinic Management Dashboard**: Redesign the clinic management overview to show Active Clinics, Inactive Clinics, and all Categories interactively, allowing filtering by status and category with professional styling.
-   **Biometric/Selfie Verification & Planning System**: Implement biometric/selfie verification for medical rep daily login and a comprehensive planning system for admins, managers, and users.

<current_work>
Immediately prior to this summary, the AI engineer was addressing a detailed bug report from the user. The primary focus was on resolving persistent issues with the frontend's styling and functionality, as well as integrating new core features.

Specifically, the engineer:
1.  **Attempted to fix the Theme System**: This involved modifying  and  to correctly apply the dynamic themes, which the user reported as still not working.
2.  **Addressed Header Formatting**: Edits were made to  and  to improve the header's appearance and integrate global search/theme toggles, but the user reported it was still unformatted. A missing  state was added to .
3.  **Reduced Modal Transparency**:  was updated to lessen the transparency of pop-up modals, as requested by the user.
4.  **Initiated Activity Tracking Module**: A new component, , was created under .
5.  **Attempted Integration of Activity Tracking**: The engineer was in the process of adding the new  tab to  and . This proved problematic, leading to persistent  issues in . The engineer tried multiple fixes for this, ultimately deciding to delete and recreate the  file to resolve the syntax errors.

The current state is that the  file has just been recreated (or its content entirely replaced) to fix parsing errors related to adding the  module. The frontend services were restarted, but the outcome of this specific fix and the state of the broader issues reported in Chat Message 179 (e.g., theme, product delete, Google Maps) are yet to be fully confirmed or addressed.

<optional_next_step>
Verify the  fix and restart frontend, then systematically address the remaining bugs listed in the last user message, starting with the theme system.
