The AI engineer successfully escalated the EP Group System from MVP to an extensive enterprise solution. Initial work focused on a hierarchical role system, admin settings, and UI/UX with React, FastAPI, and MongoDB. Key removals included chat features. Subsequently, the engineer implemented a Warehouse Keeper Dashboard, an Approval System, enhanced User Management, and a Monthly Planning System.

The provided trajectory details the AI's recent efforts: a comprehensive system review to ensure all buttons and functions work correctly for all user roles, with full admin configurability. This involved extensive debugging of frontend JSX parsing errors in  using . Major feature enhancements included unifying the header's theme toggle, refining user registration (adding no manager option, renaming Role to Job Title, fixing user addition, and making fields optional), and building a full invoicing system with tiered pricing, cashback, and edit tracking, along with comprehensive admin/warehouse keeper product management. Crucially, over 20 new backend APIs were developed for these features. Finally, the AI addressed language system issues (adding translations, improving RTL) and implemented a mini profile for all users, summarizing sales, debt, and manager info, which is currently being integrated into the header.

<product_requirements>
The EP Group System is an enterprise management solution providing dynamic themes, global search, dashboards, and user/warehouse management. It requires full Arabic/English translation, granular admin settings, redefined roles (GM, Line, Area, District, Key Account, Medical Rep), and Line 1/Line 2 division. Core functionalities include full CRUD for warehouses/products, advanced invoicing, an AI-powered gamification system, and a complete accounting system. Features like Chat, Document Scanner, and Secret Reports were explicitly removed. A hierarchical order approval flow (Rep -> District Manager -> Area/Line Manager -> Accounting -> Warehouse) and a professional approvals page are needed. Enhanced user management necessitates fields like region, direct manager, and photo upload. Managers require a monthly planning system for rep movements/clinic visits, visible to Admin/GM. Recent user input demanded all buttons/functions work correctly for all users, with comprehensive admin control and configurability. Further requests include a single header theme toggle, suitable text/input colors, page-wide language application (excluding names/regions), close buttons for all pop-ups, no manager option in user registration, renaming Role to Job Title, fixing user addition, making only essential user fields required, displaying stock status for sales reps on the dashboard, automatic invoicing for every order (with team views for managers), detailed time/date tracking of invoice edits visible only to admin, formatted order pages with products filtered by rep's line, full admin CRUD for products, warehouse keeper stock-only control, tiered product pricing (1, 10, 25, 50, 100 items with admin-configurable discounts), admin-controlled cashback system, and a comprehensive mini profile for all users showing sales movements, direct manager, region, orders count, and debt, accessible from the header.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was addressing the user's latest set of explicit requirements, specifically focusing on the language system and implementing a mini profile feature.

The AI engineer has:
1.  **Fixed Language System**: Identified and resolved a conflict in language usage (). This involved adding over 50 new Arabic translations and improving RTL (Right-to-Left) support across various system parts like products, invoices, orders, inventory, and the new mini profile (, ).
2.  **Implemented Mini Profile**: Developed a comprehensive mini profile for every user (). This profile is designed to display a user's sales movements, direct manager, region, total orders, and current debt, along with a mini summary (). A new Backend API () was added to support fetching this data (). Frontend components were added to display this profile, including tabs for Summary, Sales, Debt, Region, and Team (). The mini profile was made accessible by adding a button within the  section ().
3.  **Integrating Mini Profile into Header (Ongoing)**: The current, unfinished task is to make this mini profile accessible directly from the header. The user specifically requested that it opens when they click on profile from the name menu in the top left of the header (). The AI identified the existing  function and the  state in  (). It attempted to modify  to open the  instead of an older  (). The AI removed the old  and its state variable (, ). However, despite these efforts, testing revealed that the Profile button itself was either missing or not correctly triggering the  display (). The trajectory ends with the AI looking to correctly integrate the  component within the  component, where the header resides, to ensure it triggers correctly.
