The AI engineer successfully enhanced the EP Group System through multiple iterations. Initially, the focus was on addressing critical bug fixes related to language translation (Arabic/English) and theme consistency, ensuring the  function and  hook were correctly implemented across the frontend and theme variables were optimized. Following this, the engineer tackled major feature enhancements. A comprehensive 8-warehouse system was integrated, with a new backend API for region-specific stock status and a dedicated Stock Status section on the Medical Rep Dashboard. The daily login system was upgraded, replacing mandatory selfies with a fingerprint option, and a robust admin log was implemented to track rep logins, including location. Currently, the engineer is deeply involved in a large-scale refactor of core modules: Create Order, Visit Registration, and Monthly Planning System. This involves significant UI redesigns, new backend APIs for features like voice notes, and dynamic clinic/product listings. A persistent JSX parsing error in  at line 16514 (and later 26317) has become a recurring challenge, hindering visible changes and requiring immediate attention before proceeding.

<product_requirements>
The EP Group System is an enterprise management solution featuring dynamic themes, global search, and comprehensive user/warehouse management, supporting Arabic/English translation and a 7-level organizational hierarchy. Core functionalities include full CRUD for warehouses/products, advanced invoicing with tiered pricing, cashback, and a hierarchical order approval system. A monthly planning system for reps and managers, and enhanced user management (region, direct manager fields) are also implemented.

Recent explicit demands focused on:
1.  **Bug Fixes**: Ensure all buttons work, unify header theme toggle, improve UI color consistency, fix language translation issues.
2.  **User Management**: Refine user registration (e.g., no manager option, Job Title instead of Role, optional fields).
3.  **Warehouse/Stock**: Display stock status for sales reps, allow admin control over warehouses, warehouse keeper control over stock, reps only see stock from allowed regional warehouses.
4.  **Invoicing**: Automatic invoicing for every order with detailed edit tracking for admin.
5.  **Mini Profile**: Comprehensive mini profile accessible from the header.
6.  **Location Tracking**: Fixed Google Maps for clinic registration (user-selected + rep's actual location for admin), stealthy location tracking for orders, admin interface for location tracking.
7.  **Daily Login**: Replace selfie with fingerprint (selfie optional), log all rep logins (time, date, location) for admin.
8.  **Order Creation**: Redesign UI, replace dropdowns for clinics (filter by rep's region), add Free Demo or Debt order types, add notes, remove Approve Order button from creation, simplify product display (name, quantity, stock indicator), add order importance levels.
9.  **Visit Registration**: Redesign UI, change Select Doctor to Select Clinic (professional style, not dropdown), replace Select Clinic with Doctor Name (text input), add text/voice notes (with voice-to-text for Egyptian Arabic), hide rep's current location from rep, show maps for Admin/GM only, detailed visit reports with clinic/rep location maps and distance warnings, Visit with Manager? option.
10. **Monthly Planning**: Redesign for comprehensive planning.
11. **Clinic Registration**: Redesign for professional and streamlined experience.
12. **Dashboard**: Improve Welcome back message with date/time/last login, add approvals shortcut, stock status section, fix Quick Actions.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was actively engaged in a multi-phase refactoring and feature implementation effort based on the user's extensive new requirements.

Specifically, the work included:
1.  **Phase 1: Language and Theme Fixes**:
    *   **Theme Toggle**: Fixed the theme toggle in the  component by correcting the function call from  to  in .
    *   **Translation (i18n)**: Systematically replaced hardcoded Arabic and English strings with the  translation function across  (e.g., in  and  components), ensuring the  hook was correctly applied where needed.
    *   **Theme Colors**: Updated  to improve text clarity and comfort across themes.
    *   Backend Google Maps system tests were run and passed 100%.

2.  **Phase 2: Warehouse System and Daily Login Updates**:
    *   **Warehouse Management**: Implemented an 8-warehouse system by creating and executing  to populate the database.
    *   **Stock Status for Reps**: Added a new API endpoint in  () to fetch region-specific stock data. Integrated a Stock Status section into the  in  to display this information.  and  were used to generate test data and users. The backend API for products was updated to fetch from .
    *   **User Visibility Fix**: Adjusted  in  to ensure reps only see relevant users.
    *   **Daily Login (Fingerprint/Selfie)**: Began implementing a  (fingerprint) system. Created an  component in  to replace . Added a new API endpoint in  to log daily logins with location data for admin. An  component was added to  with corresponding navigation for admins. Backend tests for this phase showed 90% success, with a minor route ordering issue subsequently fixed in .

3.  **Phase 3 (Ongoing): Core Module Redesign (Order, Visit, Planning)**:
    *   **Order Creation Redesign**: Started refactoring the  component in  to meet new UI/functionality requirements (e.g., non-dropdown clinic selection, new order types). A backend API was added to fetch clinics based on the rep's region, and  was used to generate test data.
    *   **Visit Registration Redesign**: Began redesigning the  component in  to include voice notes and integrate Web Speech API for Arabic voice-to-text. New backend APIs were added in  to support voice notes in visit records.
    *   **Monthly Planning Redesign**: Started enhancing the  component in  and added corresponding backend APIs in .

A recurring critical issue throughout Phase 3 has been persistent JSX parsing errors in  (specifically at line 16514 and later 26317), which prevent frontend compilation and changes from being visible to the user. The engineer is currently in the process of debugging and resolving this syntax error, which appears to stem from remnants of old component code or incorrect component replacement during the extensive refactoring. The trajectory ends with the engineer attempting to fix line 26317.
