The previous AI engineer's work transitioned from stabilizing an MVP by fixing critical UI/UX bugs, particularly around the header and theme consistency, to implementing major new features. Initially, the focus was on a comprehensive header redesign and resolving persistent front-end issues. Following this, the engineer ensured database integrity before embarking on new feature development. The Advanced Notification System and Integrated CRM System were successfully delivered. Most recently, the engineer worked on the Advanced Analytics System, completing its backend and initial frontend integration. The trajectory then pivoted to user-reported bugs in user and product management, including fixing product deletion (from soft to hard delete) and user API discrepancies. Subsequently, system cleanup, debt/invoicing integration, and a comprehensive user edit feature were implemented. The final phase of work involved significant UI/UX enhancements requested by the user, such as removing old components, improving themes, revamping the admin dashboard, enhancing visit management, restoring debt/collection, and developing an interactive map for activity tracking. The trajectory concludes with the engineer in the process of implementing the interactive map for activity tracking.

<product_requirements>
The EP Group System is an enterprise application for multi-level user and warehouse management, supporting Arabic/English, dynamic themes, global search, CRUD, invoicing, hierarchical order approval, and monthly planning. Core features include user performance cards, clinic management with interactive maps, product/warehouse inventory, daily login records, activity tracking, and visit management with voice-to-text notes. Order prices are hidden for non-accountants, and authentication includes biometric/selfie login.

Recent additions and fixes: Debt and Collection module, Admin Dashboard enhancements (linking stats, quick actions, PDF export), persistent UI bug fixes (header, dashboard elements, responsiveness, pop-ups), system logo integration across pages, a complete header redesign (advanced search, 7 themes, user mini-profile), theme re-evaluation for aesthetics, and critical database consistency improvements. Newly implemented features include an Advanced Notification System, an Integrated CRM System, and an Advanced Analytics System (currently being built). User also requested comprehensive user editing, detailed user profiles, full product deletion, system cleanup, enhanced debt/invoicing, improved themes (Tajawal font, dropdown visibility), an interactive rep map in activity tracking, enhanced admin dashboard (accurate filters, orders/visits/debts/collections sections), and enhanced visit management.

<current_work>
Immediately prior to this summary, the previous AI engineer was actively working on refining and enhancing the core application modules based on recent user feedback. The work involved significant UI/UX improvements and backend refactoring for various sections.

Specifically, the engineer:
1.  **Removed Daily Login Records**: The  file was modified to remove references to , aligning with the user's request to streamline login-related components.
2.  **Improved Themes and Font**:  was updated to improve theme consistency and  was modified to ensure correct dropdown visibility based on themes. The  font was implemented as the unified system font.
3.  **Initiated Dashboard Enhancement**: A new  component was created in  to develop a more organized and data-rich admin dashboard.  was updated to use this new component.
4.  **Initiated Enhanced Visit Management**: A new  component was created in  to provide more detailed, admin-only access and exportable visit logs.  was updated to use this.
5.  **Re-integrated Debt and Collection**: A new frontend component  was created in , and it was integrated into  and  following the user's request for its restoration and tight linking.
6.  **Developing Enhanced Activity Tracking**: The most recent task was to enhance activity tracking to include an interactive map for active representatives and their locations, and remove the ineffective location tracking. An  component was created in  to handle this. The engineer encountered lint errors during this process and decided to re-create the component, then was about to update  to integrate it.
