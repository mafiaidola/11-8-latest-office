<analysis>
The previous AI engineer successfully evolved the EP Group System from an MVP to a comprehensive enterprise solution, iteratively responding to user feedback. Key accomplishments include addressing UI/UX issues, implementing a robust hierarchical role system with extensive admin settings (22 tabs), and integrating dynamic SVG icons and Google Maps. The engineer followed a full-stack approach using React, FastAPI, and MongoDB, ensuring API protection and testing. Recent efforts primarily focused on a major cleaning phase to remove undesired features like Chat, Secret Reports, and Document Scanner. Following this, the engineer embarked on significant new feature development, including a dedicated Warehouse Keeper Dashboard, a hierarchical Approval System, enhanced User Management (linking users to regions/managers with photo upload), and initiated a Monthly Planning System for managers. The work demonstrates strong technical capability and adherence to a structured development process.

<product_requirements>
The EP Group System is an enterprise management solution featuring dynamic themes, global search, statistical dashboards, user management with hierarchy, warehouse module, visit logs, reports, and a Secret Report. Initial focus was on UI/translation fixes, analytics, gamification, GPS, and document scanning. Current priorities include:
1.  **Language Switching**: Full Arabic/English translation for UI.
2.  **Comprehensive Admin Settings**: Granular control over features, including Area Management (regions, lines, teams, managers), and re-structured roles (GM, Line Manager, Area Manager, District Manager, Key Account, Medical Rep).
3.  **System Division**: Line 1 and Line 2 with distinct products/management.
4.  **Warehouse Management**: Full CRUD for warehouses and products, admin-controlled; stock management by warehouse keeper.
5.  **Advanced Invoicing**: Robust generation, export, print (with logo, details, formatting, PDF), and management.
6.  **Gamification**: Transition to tangible incentive systems with AI, configurable settings, and focus on managers/reps.
7.  **Accounting System**: Completion and integration.
8.  **AI/Analytics, UX, Reports**: Continued enhancements.
9.  **Removals**: Full removal of Chat, Document Scanner, Secret Reports.
10. **Order Hierarchy**: Rep initiates, Accounting approves, then Warehouse approves.
11. **Warehouse/Region/Rep Linkage**: Each warehouse linked to a region, each region to min. 2 reps. Reps see stock status before ordering.
12. **Approvals Section**: Professional approvals page with history (time/date), visible to admin.
13. **User Management**: New user requires region, direct manager, photo, full data (admin editable).
14. **Monthly Planning (Manager)**: Manager plans rep movements/clinic visits, notes issues, visible to Admin/GM.

<key_technical_concepts>
-   **Full-Stack Development**: React.js (Frontend), FastAPI (Backend), MongoDB (Database).
-   **UI/UX**: Tailwind CSS, CSS Custom Properties (theming), SVG animations, i18n/L10n.
-   **API Design**: RESTful APIs, Pydantic, Role-Based Access Control.
-   **State Management**: React Context API (Theme, Auth, Language).
-   **Third-Party Integrations**: Google Maps API, OpenAI GPT-4 (AI for Gamification).
</key_technical_concepts>

<code_architecture>
The application uses a standard full-stack architecture: React for the frontend, FastAPI for the backend, and MongoDB for data storage.



-   ****:
    -   **Summary of importance**: The central React application file, managing routing, global state (Theme, Auth, Language), and integrating all primary UI components.
    -   **Changes made**: Substantial modifications were made. It now supports the new hierarchical roles (GM, Line, Area, District, Key Account, Medical Rep) and the Comprehensive Admin Settings system (22 tabs). It integrates a dynamic SVG icon system and Google Maps. Recent critical changes include:
        -   Addition of  and  modals (e.g., , , ).
        -   Integration of , , , , and  components.
        -   **Removal of , , and  components** and their corresponding navigation links and display areas.
        -   Fixes for component naming conflicts.
-   ****:
    -   **Summary of importance**: Defines global CSS styles, theme-specific variables, and animations, leveraging Tailwind CSS.
    -   **Changes made**: Added styles for new themes, SVG icon animations, UI enhancements (glass, glow effects), footer animations, updated scrollbar styling, and styles for new switch components. No direct new changes in the current trajectory.
-   ****:
    -   **Summary of importance**: The FastAPI backend, acting as the central API, handling business logic, user authentication, data processing, and MongoDB interactions.
    -   **Changes made**: Enhanced existing APIs and added  (though Secret Reports component was removed from frontend). Implemented multi-lingual  APIs. Developed , , , , and  APIs (frontend components were removed). Crucially, re-structured role hierarchy and added APIs for managing Regions and Lines. Implemented Comprehensive Admin Control APIs for settings, Google Maps, site, performance, and feature toggles (13 new APIs). Added APIs for **Warehouse Management** (CRUD for warehouses and products) and **Invoice System** (models and APIs for creation). Fixed FastAPI route ordering. No specific backend changes mentioned in the current trajectory, only frontend integration.
-   ****:
    -   **Summary of importance**: Contains the original problem statement, testing protocols, and a log of past agent communications and testing results.
    -   **Changes made**: Regularly updated with new tasks, test results, and summaries of implemented features throughout the development phases. The engineer updated it after backend testing.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was actively engaged in a multi-phase development effort based on new, detailed user requirements.
**Phase 1: Cleaning and Removal**
The engineer successfully removed the following components and their related UI elements (navigation tabs, display areas, icons) from :
-   
-   
-   
This ensures a cleaner, more focused application based on current user needs.

**Phase 2: Warehouse Keeper Dashboard**
-   The Warehouse Keeper role was added to system translations.
-   A new  component was created in .
-   Modals for product addition () and stock adjustment () were added and integrated.
-   The  was integrated into the main navigation and display area.

**Phase 3: Hierarchical Approval System**
-   A new  component was created in .
-   An  was added for managing order details and approvals.
-   The  was integrated into the main navigation and display area.

**Phase 4: Enhanced User Management**
-   An  component was created in .
-   A  was added for user creation/editing, including photo upload and linking to regions/managers.

**Phase 5: Monthly Planning System**
-   The development of a  component was initiated in .
-    and  were added.
The system has been backend tested successfully, but frontend navigation and session issues were observed during previous testing. The engineer is currently about to integrate the  into the main navigation.
