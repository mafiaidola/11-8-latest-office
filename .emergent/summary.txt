The AI engineer's trajectory demonstrates a complex, iterative development process focused on enhancing a Medical Management System. Initial work covered stability and branding. A significant portion was dedicated to the Enhanced Clinic Registration module, debugging persistent frontend issues related to Google Maps functionality (draggable pin, current location), classifications, and geographic data (lines and areas). This involved extensive modifications across both React frontend components (e.g., ) and FastAPI backend models/routes (e.g., ). User feedback repeatedly highlighted issues with the map and data consistency, leading to deep dives into backend data ( for areas) and frontend rendering problems. The most recent and ongoing task is a major re-architecture of the main Dashboard to be role-based and data-driven, replacing dummy data with real database figures. This involves creating numerous new backend and frontend files to support a modular dashboard system, and the AI engineer is in the process of integrating these components.

The overarching goal is to transform a Medical Management System into a robust, visually consistent, and feature-rich application. Initial requirements included: code cleanup, removal of Made by Emergent branding, and fixing text visibility. A major feature was integrating Debt Management and Collection with Accounts and Invoicing into a unified, tamper-proof accounting system. Crucially, consistent theme and visual design, including responsive layouts for all devices (desktop, tablet, mobile), were demanded. Subsequent major requirements included: merging Debts and Collection with Invoices and Accounts into a single financial module, adding a Visit Management system for representatives linked to available clinics, and significantly enhancing the clinic registration module. This enhancement required detailed categorization (e.g., Class A star, Class A-D), Google Maps integration (draggable pins, current location), linking clinics to lines and regions for access control, removal of sample locations, and creating an admin log for clinic registrations and modifications. Most recently, the dashboard needs to be professionally restructured to offer role-specific interfaces with accurate, real-time data from the database.

<current_work>
Immediately prior to this summary, the AI engineer initiated a significant re-architecture of the application's central dashboard. The user explicitly requested a professional, role-based dashboard system where each user level (e.g., Admin, Manager) would have a distinct interface displaying accurate figures derived directly from the database, rather than dummy data.

The AI engineer has begun the implementation of this new feature. This involves:
1.  **Backend**: Creating new Pydantic models () and FastAPI routes () to manage and serve role-specific dashboard data. The  has been updated to register these new routes.
2.  **Frontend**:
    *   Development of multiple new React components, including specific dashboards for , , , , , and .
    *   Creation of supporting common components like , , , , and .
    *   The main  has been modified to dynamically render the appropriate sub-dashboard based on the user's role. It currently uses *mock data* to test the new structure, with real API integration pending.

The last explicit action in the trajectory (Chat Message 116) was the AI engineer preparing to update  to ensure all these newly created dashboard components are properly registered. This new dashboard development follows extensive prior work on the Enhanced Clinic Registration module, addressing issues like Google Maps' current location feature and ensuring accurate regional data fetching (lines and areas), including resolving data consistency in the backend models.
