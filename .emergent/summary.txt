The AI engineer's trajectory showcases a dynamic, multi-phase development process for a React/FastAPI/MongoDB application. Initially, the focus was on critical backend CRUD operation fixes, successfully resolving issues in  endpoints, clinic and warehouse APIs. Following a comprehensive user bug report and new feature requests, the engineer systematically addressed persistent UI/UX issues related to themes, header, text readability, and functional buttons (add user, create order). A significant pivot occurred towards implementing advanced mapping features for clinic registration and activity tracking, which involved creating new components and integrating live GPS. The most recent phase began tackling a substantial list of new requirements, including detailed user management fields and complex order management logic, along with ongoing UI/UX refinements. The process is iterative, characterized by deep debugging (including console logs and backend tests) and direct user feedback, with the engineer methodically working through reported issues and new features.

The EP Group System is an enterprise application for multi-level user and warehouse management, featuring Arabic/English localization, dynamic themes, global search, and comprehensive CRUD operations. Core functionalities include user performance tracking, clinic management with interactive maps, product/warehouse inventory, activity tracking, and visit management.

Recent improvements include a Debt and Collection Module, enhanced Admin Dashboard, UI bug fixes, Database Consistency, and new Advanced Notifications, CRM, and Analytics systems. User management now supports comprehensive editing and profiles.

Despite fixes, the user reported recurring UI/UX issues (overlapping sections, inconsistent themes, unreadable text, non-functional header menus/modals, text overflow). Critical backend/frontend functions were broken (global search, add user, create order, clinic/warehouse product CRUD, area management). New requirements include: integrating debt/collection with accounting/invoicing (robust data linking, Arabic print/export, system logo); accurate dashboard numbers (showing zero if no data); add debt functionality; formatted Dashboard Quick Actions; Recent Activities section on dashboard (Representative Visits, Collection). User updated requirements further: live GPS map for clinic registration (non-editable, precise location logging in a printable Movement Log tab in clinic profile linked to lines); enhanced clinic add/edit (all profile fields, rep editable, hidden Movement Log for admin/manager with audit trail); clinic team linking (rep, manager, line, warehouse); professional formatting for orders, debts, visits in clinic profile; product-based debt statistics; **dark theme only, other themes removed, all text color fixed for visibility**; comprehensive user creation fields (Direct Manager, Area, Line - non-dropdowns); refined order management (rep can create, role-based visibility, approval flow tracking, rep sees *their* clinics/warehouse stock non-dropdown, no prices for reps); Rep dashboard quick actions, stock, visits; new Plan section (hierarchical, non-deletable entries without admin approval); detailed warehouse management (product stock, edit products/quantity, orders tab for managers); new Visits section for reps (clinic selection by area/line, visit purpose options non-dropdown, notes with voice-to-text, hidden rep location logging, printable details); Visit Management (admin) with Clinic Registration tab for detailed log; integrated Debt/Collection with Accounting (professional, accurate, partial/full payment per product). The cannot edit areas, areas appear inactive issue was re-reported.

<current_work>
Immediately prior to this summary, the AI engineer was addressing a comprehensive set of new requirements from the user, following successful fixes of critical backend CRUD operations, UI/UX issues (header, themes, text readability, / buttons), and the integration of advanced mapping for clinic registration and activity tracking.

The current work is focused on implementing the detailed changes requested in Chat Message 210, which represents a significant expansion of core functionalities. The engineer is proceeding systematically, having completed the following high-priority items:
1.  **Theme and Text Color Fixes**: All themes except the dark theme have been removed, and text colors have been adjusted across the application to ensure better visibility and contrast.
2.  **Live GPS Map for Clinic Registration**: A  component has been created and integrated into . This map now displays the user's live, non-editable current location for precise clinic registration, and the backend () has been updated to store this location data with the clinic.
3.  **User Management Enhancements**:
    *   The Error loading comprehensive data bug when viewing user details (in ) has been resolved.
    *   The  component for creating new users has been significantly updated to include mandatory fields for Direct Manager, Area, Line, and Section. These fields are now displayed using radio buttons or text inputs instead of dropdowns as requested, enhancing the user experience.

The engineer has just finished verifying these improvements via frontend screenshots and testing, confirming their successful implementation. The very next step involved tackling **Order Management Issues** (filtering by user roles, allowing reps to create orders), by starting to refactor  and , cleaning up old mock data and fixing linting errors during this process. After completing the Order Management refactor (confirming the Create Order button is hidden for admin, as intended), the engineer then moved on to the next major task: **linking clinics to lines and fixing area management issues**. The last action was attempting to inspect and modify  to address the persistent problem of areas appearing inactive and being uneditable.

<optional_next_step>
The next step is to continue debugging and fixing the  component to resolve the issue where areas appear inactive and cannot be edited.
