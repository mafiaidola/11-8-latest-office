The previous AI engineer’s trajectory demonstrates an iterative, feedback-driven development approach focused on transforming a Medical Management System. Initially, the work addressed core application stability and branding issues, followed by a major financial system integration. Persistent user feedback drove subsequent efforts to fix pervasive theme inconsistencies and, critically, responsive design issues across various devices. The engineer meticulously debugged authentication flows and applied comprehensive CSS overhauls. Most recently, the focus shifted to enhancing the clinic registration module, incorporating complex features like Google Maps integration and detailed permission-based views. The process involved identifying root causes, implementing targeted fixes, and continuously testing based on user reports, showcasing adaptability in addressing evolving requirements and bugs.

<product_requirements>
The overarching goal is to transform a Medical Management System into a robust, visually consistent, and feature-rich application. Initial requirements included: code review/cleanup, removal of Made by Emergent branding, and fixing initial theme issues like poor text visibility. A major feature addition was the integration of a Debt Management and Collection with Accounts and Invoicing into a unified, tamper-proof accounting system. Crucially, a persistent demand was for comprehensive theme and visual consistency across all parts of the application, ensuring optimal contrast and eliminating visual errors. Most recently, the user reported critical responsive design issues across desktop, tablet, and mobile devices. Following these, the user requested to merge Debts and Collection with Invoices and Accounts into a single, cohesive financial module, add a Visit Management system for representatives linked to available clinics, and significantly enhance the clinic registration module to include detailed categorization, Google Maps integration (with draggable pins and current location), linking clinics to lines and regions for access control, removal of sample locations, and creating an admin log for clinic registrations and modifications.

<current_work>
Immediately prior to this summary, the AI engineer was deep into enhancing the  module, based on specific user feedback regarding its current issues and desired functionalities. The user reported that the current clinic module lacks categorization, has non-functional map integration (expecting a draggable Google Maps pin for current location), doesn't link clinics to lines and regions for representative availability, and contains hardcoded sample locations that need removal. Additionally, the user requested an admin-facing log of clinic registrations showing user details, modification times, and location data.

The AI engineer has already initiated this work by:
1.  Creating new backend models: .
2.  Creating new backend routes: .
3.  Creating new frontend UI components:  (for the main registration form) and  (for the admin view).
4.  Updating  to include the new .
5.  Updating  and  to integrate the new clinic components into the application's navigation and component loading system.

The work is currently focused on fleshing out these new components and ensuring the frontend and backend correctly handle the new data structures and map functionalities, specifically the add available clinics component as part of Phase 6. The previous phase involved fixing  errors in the frontend's tab filtering logic (in  and ) that were blocking UI display after recent changes.
