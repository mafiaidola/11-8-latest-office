The AI engineer's trajectory demonstrates an iterative, bug-fixing, and feature-enhancement workflow. Initially, the focus was on critical application functionality: resolving a persistent login failure where  was  and the login form submission was not firing. This involved extensive debugging of frontend () event handlers and state management, eventually necessitating a  call.

Once login was stable, the engineer moved to backend API modularization, creating  and , and fixing authorization issues. Subsequent major efforts included fixing the Lines Management system by adding missing backend APIs and frontend UI (, ,  updates), then overhauling Product Management to meet new UI and permission requirements. Finally, duplicate Region Management modules were removed, unifying lines and areas into one module. The work concluded with the user requesting further modifications to the User Registration form, which the AI engineer began investigating. Throughout, the engineer actively used  and  and updated .

The EP Group System is an enterprise application for multi-level user and warehouse management, supporting Arabic/English, dynamic themes, and global search. It features CRUD operations, advanced invoicing, hierarchical order approval, and monthly planning. Prior work included bug fixes, user management, region-specific stock, automated invoicing, mini-profiles, enhanced location tracking, and UI redesigns for order creation, visit registration, and monthly planning.

Recent user requests and bug reports include:
*   Merging  and  into a single executive role.
*   Implementing a Lines Management system.
*   User management with performance cards.
*   Intelligent colored clinic categorization (new/green, featured/gold, debt/red) and comprehensive clinic mini-profiles.
*   Invoice-based debt system with warnings.
*   Manager inclusion in visit logs and restricted rep profiles.
*   Detailed movement log.
*   A revamped, modern, animated, and professional dashboard with horizontal navigation.
*   **Critical Bugs**: New dashboard design non-functional, login page lacking demo users, broken dashboard themes, vertical admin menu, and overall data integrity.
*   **Specific Updates (recent)**: Fix Lines Management (cannot add lines/products), fix permissions for various roles, fix multiple data loading errors (gamification, GPS, planning, clinics), fix clinic addition error, and overhaul Product Management (remove search/filter, specific unit dropdowns, link lines, remove tiered pricing/cashback, price visibility control, simplified product table).
*   **Current Request**: In Users Management for new user, change Work Information section from dropdowns to an organized grid with icons, include Line field linked to Lines/Areas, and ensure all parts are interconnected for increased productivity.

<current_work>
Immediately prior to this summary, the AI engineer was tasked with a significant overhaul of the Users Management section, specifically focusing on the Work Information part when adding a new user. The user explicitly requested to change the display from dropdowns to a grid layout, include icons indicating job titles, and integrate a Line field that pulls data from the newly fixed Lines and Areas Management section. The goal is to enhance organization and productivity.

Before this request, the AI engineer successfully addressed several critical issues and feature enhancements:
1.  **Login Functionality**: Debugged and fixed  being  in  and resolved the issue where the login form was not submitting/redirecting despite successful backend authentication. This involved using  and adding extensive console logs.
2.  **API Modularization**: Created and integrated  and  into , and fixed authorization for .
3.  **Lines and Areas Management**: Implemented backend APIs () and corresponding frontend UI ( component in ), allowing users to add lines and assign products. Also consolidated the separate Areas Management module into Lines and Areas Management.
4.  **Product Management**: Revamped the Products Management module by removing search/filter bars, modifying the product addition modal () to include specific unit options (, ), integrating lines from the Lines Management system, removing tiered pricing/cashback, and controlling price visibility based on user roles (Admin/Accounting only).
5.  **Data Loading Fixes**: Added missing backend APIs for Gamification, GPS Tracking, Planning, and Clinics to resolve data loading errors reported by the user.
6.  **Add Clinic Bug Fix**: Implemented the missing  endpoint in the backend to resolve an error when adding new clinics.

The current work focuses on the Users Management section ( component, likely in ), with the AI engineer having just initiated a search for the relevant component to begin modifications (Chat 374, 376).

<optional_next_step>
The next step is to examine the  component in  and begin restructuring its Work Information section into a grid layout, as per the user's request.
