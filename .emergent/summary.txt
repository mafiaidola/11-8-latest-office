The AI engineer's work follows an iterative, bug-fixing, and feature-enhancement trajectory on an existing full-stack application (React, FastAPI, MongoDB). The initial phase involved understanding the codebase and fixing critical login issues. Subsequently, major efforts focused on revamping core modules like User Management and Clinic Registration, and integrating Lines and Areas Management. For User Management, the engineer addressed persistent user display issues, implemented a new grid-based Work Information section with role-based colored cards, and added bulk actions, while ensuring correct API linkages. Clinic Registration saw a consolidation of duplicate tabs, enhancement of location tracking (including fixing map display, draggable pins, and location saving), improving GPS accuracy, and integrating credit status and clinic classification. Speech-to-text for voice notes in visit registration was also implemented. Throughout, the engineer demonstrated strong debugging skills, utilizing  and / extensively. The work concluded with the user requesting a comprehensive review of Product Management.

The EP Group System is an enterprise application designed for multi-level user and warehouse management, supporting Arabic/English localization, dynamic themes, and global search. Key features include CRUD operations, advanced invoicing, hierarchical order approval, and monthly planning. Previous work focused on foundational bug fixes and core module enhancements like user management, region-specific stock, automated invoicing, mini-profiles, enhanced location tracking, and UI redesigns.

Recent and ongoing development focuses on:
*   **User Management:** Consolidate  and  into a single executive role (implied by role card updates). Implement a Lines Management system and integrate it into User Registration's Work Information section, changing it to an organized grid with icons, linked to Lines/Areas. Enhance user list display to show all users (including admin/temporary), add role-based colored cards, and implement bulk actions (e.g., delete).
*   **Clinic Management:**
    *   **Clinic Registration:** Merge duplicate Clinic Registration tabs/buttons into a single, unified Register Clinic interface. Implement new clinic classification (Class A Star, A, B, C, D) using interactive cards, not dropdowns. Introduce a credit status system (Green/Yellow/Red) linked to accounting, with warnings for delegates during visits/orders. Hide sensitive Registration Information from delegates and modify Important Notes (remove location tracking point). Ensure map functionality for clinic location is precise, draggable, displays current location, and saves correctly without white screen issues or field required errors.
    *   **Clinic Visit Registration:** Add a button to convert audio voice notes to text, populating an additional notes field.
*   **General Bugs & Enhancements:** Resolve critical bugs related to the new dashboard (non-functional, missing demo users, broken themes, vertical admin menu, data integrity). Fix lines management (adding lines/products), permissions, data loading for gamification, GPS, planning, and clinics. Overhaul Product Management (remove search/filter, specific unit dropdowns, link lines, remove tiered pricing/cashback, control price visibility, simplified product table).

<current_work>
Immediately prior to this summary, the AI engineer successfully resolved multiple critical bugs and implemented significant feature enhancements related to **Clinic Registration and Location Tracking**.

Specifically, the following issues were addressed:
1.  **Duplicate Clinic Sections**: The user reported two instances of ÿ™ÿ≥ÿ¨ŸäŸÑ ÿπŸäÿßÿØÿ© ÿ¨ÿØŸäÿØÿ© (Register New Clinic) on the same page. The AI engineer identified and removed the redundant rendering of the  component in , consolidating it into a single, unified tab.
2.  **Maps Functionality**: The user repeatedly reported that maps were not displaying (appearing as a white square) and that clinic location on the map was not working correctly during registration. The AI engineer:
    *   Ensured Google Maps API script was correctly loaded and handled in  (or ).
    *   Fixed the logic for the draggable pin and current location display.
    *   Crucially, resolved the issue where selected map coordinates were not being saved to the clinic payload by correcting how  and  were passed within the  function in .
    *   Significantly enhanced map accuracy by improving geolocation options (, ) and adjusting map display settings for higher precision (e.g., zoom level 18-19, hybrid view).
    *   Added UI elements for accuracy feedback (meter, high-accuracy button).
3.  **Clinic Registration Form Validation**: The ÿßŸÑÿ≠ŸÇŸÑ clinic_name ŸÖÿ∑ŸÑŸàÿ® (The clinic_name field is required) error was fixed by correcting the field name mapping in 's  function, ensuring  was correctly sent as  to the backend API.
4.  **Speech-to-Text in Clinic Visit Registration**: A new feature was implemented in the  component allowing users to convert voice notes to text. This involved integrating a üìù ÿ™ÿ≠ŸàŸäŸÑ ŸÑŸÜÿµ button that populates an additional notes text field.

The state of the product is now that **User Management**, **Clinic Registration**, and **Clinic Visit Registration** (including location tracking and speech-to-text) are fully functional, enhanced, and stable according to the latest tests. The latest user request is to conduct a comprehensive review of the Product Management section to improve its form and ensure effectiveness and efficiency.
