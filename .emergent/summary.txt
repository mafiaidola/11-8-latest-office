The AI engineer focused on enhancing the EP Group System, addressing critical bugs and implementing new features. Initial efforts involved resolving persistent JSX parsing errors in  at multiple lines, which were hindering frontend compilation. This required careful examination of component structure, missing  blocks, and incorrect component calls. Following the resolution of these core compilation issues, the engineer moved to specific user-reported bugs. This included fixing the Create Order functionality for sales reps, specifically addressing  errors by ensuring correct data structure handling from the backend API. Subsequently, the daily login system was refined to appear only once per day using . Finally, a comprehensive clinic registration feature for sales reps was implemented, integrating enhanced Google Maps with current location detection and draggable markers, ensuring auto-approval for three months, and adding hidden location tracking for admin view. The final stage involved robust debugging of  serialization issues and ensuring correct component rendering in .

<product_requirements>
The EP Group System is an enterprise management solution offering dynamic themes, global search, and comprehensive user/warehouse management, with Arabic/English support and a 7-level hierarchy. Core features include CRUD for warehouses/products, advanced invoicing, a hierarchical order approval system, monthly planning, and enhanced user management. Recent focus areas included: bug fixes (buttons, themes, language); user management refinements; displaying region-specific stock status for sales reps; automatic invoicing; a comprehensive mini-profile; enhanced location tracking for clinics and orders; replacing selfie-based daily login with fingerprint/location logging; redesigning Create Order, Visit Registration, and Monthly Planning UIs for dynamic listings, voice notes, and simplified workflows; and improving the Dashboard. The immediate problem addressed was a persistent frontend compilation error and subsequent functionality issues for sales reps.

-   ****:
    -   **Summary of importance**: The central React application file managing routing, global state, and UI components.
    -   **Changes made**: Extensive modifications to resolve persistent JSX parsing errors (lines 16514, 26317, 26614, etc.) by correcting misplaced/unclosed tags and orphaned code blocks, balancing parentheses/braces, and ensuring  is at the top level. The  component was updated to correctly handle clinic data (accessing  and adding  checks). The daily login logic was modified in  to use  for  to prevent repeated modals. A new  component was added for sales rep clinic registration with integrated Google Maps (showing current location and draggable markers). A new  component was added to display detailed tracking info for admins. Authentication context () was explicitly used in  to access user data.
-   ****:
    -   **Summary of importance**: The FastAPI backend handles all business logic, user authentication, data processing, and MongoDB interactions.
    -   **Changes made**: The  endpoint was modified to allow sales representatives to access clinics via  for consistent authentication. A new endpoint  was added to handle clinic registration by sales reps, including saving rep's current location, calculating distance to clinic, and setting . Critical fixes were made to handle MongoDB's  serialization issues by ensuring all  instances were converted to  and all  queries included  projection (e.g., for  and ). A new admin endpoint  was added to manage the auto-approval feature for a specified duration.
-   ****:
    -   **Summary of importance**: Defines global CSS, theme variables, and animations.
    -   **Changes made**: No new explicit changes mentioned in the provided trajectory, although past changes improved text visibility.
-   ****:
    -   **Summary of importance**: Stores environment variables for the frontend, including the backend URL.
    -   **Changes made**:  was added previously. No new explicit changes mentioned in this trajectory.
-   ****:
    -   **Summary of importance**: The main HTML file where the React application is mounted.
    -   **Changes made**: Google Maps JavaScript API script tag directly added previously. No new explicit changes mentioned in this trajectory.
-   ****:
    -   **Summary of importance**: Critical log for problem statements, testing protocols, agent communications, and test results.
    -   **Changes made**: Consistently updated by the AI engineer after each phase, including language/theme fixes, warehouse/stock system implementation, daily login updates, and detailed reports on debugging frontend compilation errors, fixing Create Order logic, daily login modal frequency, and the comprehensive clinic registration feature for reps, including API tests and frontend visual confirmations.
-   **Other scripts (, , , , , )**:
    -   **Summary of importance**: Used for database setup, populating test data, and initial configuration.
    -   **Changes made**: These scripts were executed during this trajectory to generate necessary test data (e.g., new sales rep, clinics) to validate the implemented features and bug fixes. No direct code modifications to these scripts were explicitly detailed in this trajectory.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer successfully resolved a critical bug reported by the user regarding clinic registration for sales representatives. The user reported ⚠️حدث خطأ في إرسال الطلب. يرجى المحاولة مرة أخرى and indicated that clinics could not be registered, even without manager approval.

The AI engineer's work focused on:
1.  **Debugging  Serialization**: Identified and fixed a recurring  error from MongoDB in the backend (). This involved ensuring that  instances were converted to  before being stored in the database (e.g., for  in clinic data). Additionally,  was explicitly added to MongoDB queries () for  and  to prevent  fields from causing serialization issues in JSON responses.
2.  **Correcting Frontend Component Usage**: Discovered that the  component was being mistakenly rendered instead of the newly developed  component for sales reps in  (line 17969). This was fixed by replacing the incorrect component call.
3.  **Ensuring User Context**: Verified that  data was correctly accessible within the  component. This was addressed by ensuring  was properly used to retrieve  from the context and updating all references within the component.
4.  **Error Handling Enhancement**: Added more robust error handling in the frontend to provide clearer feedback to the user in Arabic.
5.  **Auto-Approval System**: Confirmed that the backend's new logic for sales rep clinic registration (specifically  endpoint) allows clinics to be  without manager intervention, and this feature can be toggled by admins for a specific duration (e.g., 3 months).

The trajectory concludes with the AI engineer confidently stating that the problem is 100% solved and the system is ready for use, having successfully registered a clinic via the sales rep account and verified backend logs and API responses.
