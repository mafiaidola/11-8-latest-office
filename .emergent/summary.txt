The AI engineer's work on the EP Group System spanned several iterations, evolving from foundational setup to significant feature additions and critical bug fixes. Initially, the focus was on implementing dynamic themes, comprehensive search, and a password-protected secret report, alongside resolving core rendering issues in  and . A major phase involved developing a robust admin settings module and a fully integrated, multi-lingual accounting system, demonstrating strong backend-frontend coordination. Subsequent efforts concentrated on addressing user-reported UI/UX inconsistencies, such as theme application, language switching across all components, footer content, and rectifying the  display. The approach has been iterative, leveraging testing agents and direct user feedback to refine features and stabilize the application, prioritizing critical bug fixes before moving to new feature development.

<product_requirements>
The goal is to develop a comprehensive enterprise management system, EP Group System, with advanced UI/UX and extensive backend capabilities. Key requirements include: dynamic theme selection (9 themes with SVG animations), global search (representatives, doctors, clinics, invoices, products), interactive statistical dashboards with filtering, detailed user management (photos, individual stats, daily check-ins, hierarchy), a comprehensive warehouse module, detailed visit logs with real-time tracking, multi-format reports, a WhatsApp-like team chat, and a sensitive Secret Report with logging and filtering. The system emphasizes modern, responsive, and visually appealing design. Recent user feedback highlighted issues with inconsistent translation across all pages (including login), theme application to menus and scrollbars, outdated footer content, hidden intellectual property text, non-functional , and a need for improved user list management (including manager/warehouse assignments, last seen, activity).

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was addressing several critical UI/UX issues identified by the user after the successful implementation of the accounting system. The  name has been successfully updated throughout. Comprehensive translation (Arabic/English) has been implemented and is fully functional across most pages, including the login page, with English now as the primary display language. The theme toggle has been consolidated to a single button in the header, and the scrollbar now correctly adopts the application's theme colors. The footer has been revamped to include system-relevant links (About Us, Our Services, Contact Us, Privacy Policy, Terms of Use, Technical Support) and the intellectual property rights section (جميع حقوق الملكيه الفكريه محفوظه and Mahmoud Elmnakhli with Facebook link) is now correctly displayed with youthful, animated effects. The ongoing issue is the  component, which despite being present in the code, is still not visible on the dashboard. The AI engineer has been systematically debugging its display, recently modifying the  to include it, and is currently working on updating the footer's contact information.
